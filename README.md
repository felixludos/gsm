# Game-Set-Match: An AI-centric framework for turn-based game development

This framework is designed to allow the development of the backends to turn-based games using Python. The backend includes all the game logic and action generation.
The idea is for the backend to communicate with any frontend (eg. a GUI, an AI player) through JSON objects.

There are a few small examples of game backends implemented using GSM.

## Short-term goals

1. Test higher level functionality (eg. saving)
2. Implement testing framework
3. Document and clean code
4. Clean up error handling

## Future goals

1. AI utilities - both frontend and backend utilities to develop agents (search, RL, etc.)
2. Common game utilies - implement grids, graphs, card decks, workers, etc.
3. gUsIm - automatic GUI generator in JS (and maybe python) from a config file to streamline frontend development
4. Improve debugging and playing in console/jupyter
5. Develop GSM in Julia for performance improvements
