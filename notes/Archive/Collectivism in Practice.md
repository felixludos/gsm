# Collectivism in Practice

Originally written on December 27, 2014.

This document should present argument through logos, not ethos, and certainly not through pathos. Because I don’t focus on ethos, references are largely unnecessary, since logic is universal and not dependent on opinions or arguments of “credible” sources. Additionally, this argument is largely theoretical, so concrete evidence or examples will not be presented.

# 100% Taxes?

The overall hypothesis is that collectivism would help us fulfill our goal more efficiently than if we interacted with an individualist system. Our goal is here assumed to be the survival and prosperity of our species. Both individualism and collectivism are different systems how individuals in a society make decisions, and thereby, how they interact with each other and with their environment. In individualism individuals of a society make decisions by estimating the perceived costs and benefits to themselves for each choice they have. In collectivism, individuals consider the perceived costs and benefits of the society to each choice they are given.

# Against human nature?

Collectivism goes against one behavior that many assume is inherent to being human, self-preservation. From the principles of self-preservation all manner of laws and behaviors may be assumed concerning concepts such as property, freedom, privacy, honor, respect, faith, love, morality… Some of these ideals we have accepted for so long that we call them “human nature” to imply that breaking such ideals would be impossible.

However, I would argue no human behavior is innate. Certainly we are born with models that are meant to help individuals protect their species as well as our evolutionary history has been able to improve our models. Humans have the ability to learn or create new models and then choose which models to use to make decisions. That means that we can, in theory and practice, use different models than the ones we were born with. No one was born knowing Newton’s second law of motion, yet we can use that model to make conclusions about the world around us and thereby make decisions to fulfill our goal.

Nevertheless, collectivism may seem like a stretch, considering our evolutionary history. Humans, as most other species on Earth, have used the “individual mutation and preservation system” to evolve and survive. In this system individuals of the species mutate genetically and then try as best their genetic mutations allows them to spread their mutations to other individuals, so that, over time, the species will benefit from the mutations. This system requires self-preservation, since the individuals must want to pass on their genetic mutations. This competition system can be captured by the saying “the weak are meat and the strong do eat.”

Proxy Collectivism (individualism where costs and benefits to individuals are perceived as costs and benefits of the society).

# How much do you get?

Wrong question, you don’t matter, the society does.

# What do you decide?

Again wrong question, however you are part of the society, so you will take part in decisions made by the society through Dynamic Democracy (or similar).

# If each individual has different models, whose is better?

Science compares models. Evolution is another process to compare models, but it’s far slower.

Objective models for all contexts is not a necessity, but it would make the process of comparing the models much more precise if the models that are compared are objective rather than imaginary.

# Objective models for all decisions?

It certainly seems like a bold proposition, but one that would not only make collective decision making simpler (and thereby less costly), but it would be far easier to compare with other models, and find superior ones.

If we could develop objective models for all contexts that are scientifically superior to imaginary models, as we have in various natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biology…), then all science would become a much more powerful tool.

This is the first major issue in this theory, is it possible to develop such objective models for decisions that we have to make every day. In other words, can we develop formulas for the decisions that we make on a daily basis?

# What about differences in data?

Not only does everyone in the society have subjective models, but each individual may have access or be aware of different data when making the decision. This problem can only be solved through communication.

That brings us to the next major step, creating and perfecting our system of communication. If information does not travel efficiently and accurately throughout the society, then it won’t matter if the best available models are used, because information itself will be faulty or incomplete.
