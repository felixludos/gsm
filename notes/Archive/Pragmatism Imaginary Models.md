# Pragmatism

Pragmatism is often confused for rationalism, while in reality it is simply a more flexible version of fanaticism. Fanaticism is the acceptance of certain values when making a conclusion. Values are models that resist change, unlike scientific models which change naturally through the two laws of science, the Law of Statistics and the Law of Aesthetics. In a moral system, certain values are encouraged, while others are discouraged, that means the individuals using that moral system use certain models independently of the laws of science. The use of values, rather than adaptive, naturally improving scientific models, is fanaticism.

However the use of moral systems can still lead to a wide range of different results. Although the models are accepted to be absolute, the data individuals plug into the models is not absolute, since the data depends on the exact circumstances of the decisions the individual has to make. The origins of the data that is used also affects the accuracy of the final conclusion. If the data originates from conclusions made using other values, rather than scientific models, the final conclusion will be less accurate since it’s likelier that improved models would have come to different conclusions, changing the input data of the final model, which is more likely to change the final conclusion. Empirical evidence would also be a more accurate form of data because it is based not on values of the individuals in question, but on their perception of the world.

The form of fanaticism that tries to get the most reliable form of data is pragmatism. One of the most common areas where pragmatism, rather than rationalism, is practiced is the study of law. Since laws are accepted as absolutes, rather than naturally evolving theories, conclusions must be drawn using absolute models, or values. However, in an effort to be more accurate the study of law tries to use as reliable data as possible, often empirical is more eagerly accepted than conclusions from other values.

Pragmatism differs greatly from rationalism because it does not question the models it is given. This means pragmatism does not work on improving the model itself, it’s only used to come to a conclusion based on data provided. Pragmatism is fundamentally a computing operation, rather than a creative operation. In the computing of a model and data to come to a conclusion there is no difference between fanaticism, pragmatism, or rationalism. These systems differ only in how the models change in response to history.

# Imaginary Models

Independently of the system in use, precisely defined, objective models often don’t exist for many difference decisions that must be made. For such decisions imaginary models are used. Imaginary models can be rationalist, fanatic, or pragmatic, depending on how they change.

In praxis, imaginary models are simply the sub-consciousness processing the data to come to a conclusion. This is helpful since the sub-consciousness can make conclusions extremely quickly. Since the consciousness cannot properly define imaginary models, they will always be subjective, and therefore inferior to objective, well-defined models, where it is possible to precisely improve them through science.
