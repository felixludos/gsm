# Historical Time Dilation

Originally written May 7, 2016.

It seems very reasonable to suppose that time remains constant. One second today is much the same as one second 1000 years ago, and based on our understanding of time, it seems safe to expect a second a thousand years from now to be just the same. By time we will not consider the physical propagation through time but rather the anthropic change of time.

Like all organisms, humans interact with their environment. In fact due to relatively advanced social behaviors human are able to communicate complex ideas to other humans. The precise nature of these ideas is not important at the moment, all that is necessary is that these ideas are some pieces of information that require some amount of thought that communicate to others. Being very social,
humans are exposed to and produce a multitude of ideas throughout their lives. However there is only so much of the world an individual can interact with their environment. Having a finite attention span humans can only allocate some amount of, what we shall call, their interactivity pie, which sums up the total amount of information an individual can meaningfully absorb and process.

The first assumption that will be made in this analysis, is that throughout human history, the total size of this interactivity pie has not changed significantly. For example, how many people can an individual be acquainted with, as in how many people can an individual meaningfully know (know their name, recognize their face, remember their personality, etc.)? Whatever that number is, is there any reason that number should change significantly over the course of human history? It's certainly true that some people have always been better with names and faces, and they might remember a few more than others, but on average the number should stay quite constant. The types of people we recognize might change over time, today we might be able to recognize several celebrities and politicians that we've never spoken to, while we can name but a handful of our  neighbors, as oppose to people living centuries ago who would probably be more familiar with their neighbors than distant foreigners. In any case, it seems reasonable to assume that the total amount of the world an individual can experience in their lifetime is relatively constant. 

The second assumption is that the total number of ideas people are exposed to has increased significantly in human history. Since technology is proportional to the speed of communication and transportation in societies, and technology has unquestionably developed in human history, the number of ideas theoretically available to an individual is significantly larger today that in history.

Now consider the consequences of putting these two assumptions together. Consider the rate of ideas that a person is exposed to per second. When fixing time, that is, defining one second today to be the same as one second 1000 years ago, this idea rate would increase over the course of human history, since the speed of communication increases over time, so ideas are more easily spread.

However when keeping the number of ideas fixed, that is to say, fixing the number of ideas a person can be exposed to as the first assumption suggests, and allowing time to vary the historical time dilation appears. Since humans can only process a certain amount of information per second, and the advancements in technology expose humans to ideas more readily, as a result time itself must dilate to keep up with the influx of ideas. So under the context of historical time dilation we can argue, that a person experiencing "one minute" of time today is analogous in terms of number of ideas they are exposed to, as a person 1000 years ago experiencing "one month" (where the amount of dilation only serves to illustrate the concept).

This may seem very counterintuitive, but there is in fact another way that we can derive the effect of historical time dilation.

[number of ideas/concepts that a person has to be familiar with - so each second there is more to consider as the number of concepts grows]

[Varying amounts of understanding or consensus]
