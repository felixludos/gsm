## Survival (1/2)

The highest goal of any species is to survive, not as individuals, but as a species. Individuals will die eventually, but a species can live forever through individual reproduction. Therefore the preservation of the individual is insignificant compared to the preservation of the species.

Therefore the highest goal of every individual within a species is not merely to survive, but rather to do their utmost to ensure the survival of their species.

In order to support your species, you must contribute more than you consume. Otherwise your species suffers a net loss when you die. The greater value you contribute and the less you consume, the more the species will gain from you as an individual, which will enable it to better survive. Both the quantity and quality of the contribution should be maximized.

Obviously the species will only gain from constructive production; destructive production is no better than consumption. Constructive production is differentiated from destructive production by reason rather than ethics; since ethics can change over time and situations, while reason is timeless (1 + 1 = 2 is always correct and right, but consuming drugs may or may not be considered right).

Merely balancing the production and consumption of an individual is not enough for the species to survive. The environment changes constantly, if the species does not develop, adapt and improve, the environment will eventually kill off the species. So individuals have to not only contribute as much as they consume, but a surplus, so that the species can overcome challenges the environment will pose in the future. The species doesn’t just have to live, it has to adapt, constantly.

Your highest priority is to contribute as much value as you can. Your second highest priority is to consume as little as possible. This means that you may consume more than the bare minimum to be disproportionally more productive. Your goal in life is to maximize the ratio of production versus consumption. For example to have your life cost the species a value of 5, but produce a value of 20 is better than to have your life cost the species a value of 1 and produce a value of 2 (calculating the absolute benefit and cost of your life is in reality impossible, here used only to demonstrate an idea).

Such production comes in many forms, anything that individuals can do to support other individuals in the species, like their offspring. Providing resources, such as food, shelter or security, as well as trying to learn how to control aspects of the environment are both equally vital to the prolonged survival of the species.

Maximizing your production to consumption ratio provides the greatest benefit to the species, which in turn best helps it to prosper.

## Self-Preservation (2/2)

The best way to help our species survive is not self-preservation, and especially not selfishness. The best way to help our species survive is complete selflessness – complete sacrifice to the species.

Nature, on the other hand, does use selfishness and self-preservation to help the species survive, through variation. Nature encourages the individual to survive and pass on their genetic material, so they can increase the variation in the species, which helps it survive.

Having variation in a species is vital to its survival. When the environment changes the species has to adapt to survive in the new conditions. If there is variation within a species it can adapt easier through natural selection.

Humans are no longer subject to natural selection. Humans manipulate the environment like no other species on Earth. Humans can manipulate the natural environment so effectively that they barely have to adapt to it, at least not as a species. This means that variation is no longer as important to their survival.

The less dependent humanity is on variation the more our species should focus on specialization. Specialization is more efficient to learn how to control aspects of the environment. Specialization allows individuals in our species to study aspects of the environment in more detail. So our species can continue to learn to more effectively control our environment.

The less variation the species needs, the more specialization could benefit the species.
