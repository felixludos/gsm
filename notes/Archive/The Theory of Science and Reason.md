# Concepts and Communication

The world is made up of aspects. All objects can be measured in respect to any one aspect. In such, every object (whereby object itself is a concept) has a list of perceivable properties that make up that object.

When an individual perceives an object he perceives the properties that object displays. Properties can be compared between objects, some objects will present that aspect more than others. For example, a leaf is greener than the sky, so in the aspect green color, the leaf’s property is greater than the sky’s property. While it may be difficult to assign absolute quantitative values to some objects in a certain aspect, abstract values can be used to compare properties of two objects.

The sum of all properties of an object would make up the perfect concept of that object. However an individual’s perception of an object is imperfect, therefore his concept for that object is also imperfect. He does not use all of the object’s properties to describe the object only a few. These make up the imperfect concept or just concept of that object. For example, the concept of cooked steak may have certain relevant properties such as color (brown), texture (soft), taste (similar to other meats), size (about as big as a human hand)… if we were to perceive and object that follow all, or most of the properties we deem relevant to identifying steak, then we would no doubt think it to be a steak.

Obviously each individual’s concept of every object is slightly different. However they are only slightly different, as I’m sure your concept of a cooked steak is not all too different than mine. Why? After all for all we know each individual’s world perception can be completely different, so why should our concepts be at all similar?

Communication allows us to compare and critique each other’s concepts. When we communicate with one another we describe our concepts, and to make sure we describe them accurately we have agreed on common definitions beforehand. However definitions have to remain relatively unchanging independent of the context or situation of the conversation, while concepts, that is the relevant properties of an object, can change. For example, if we discuss apples we may be talking about the taste or cost or size, but sweet, expensive, and small are properties that will always mean the same thing, their definitions are independent of the context.

It may often be useful to use concepts to describe other concepts. For example, if I describe an apple I might mention it’s sweet, it’s juicy… but I might also say it’s a fruit, which, provided we have similar concepts for fruit, might tell you more about what an apple is. Concepts that can be described with other concepts can be called complex concepts. Were it not for complex concepts we would have a much harder time discussing abstract concepts. However our communication has become so advanced and complex that nearly all our concepts can be described using other concepts.

While this may seem straightforward for simple concrete concepts like apples, finding and agreeing on properties that are relevant to a complex abstract concept can become extremely difficult. For example, we can agree on the definition of good, but if we take a concept, like abortion it’s much more difficult agree on whether that concept presents that property or not.

That brings us to a major problem with our communication system. If we use concepts upon concepts to describe other concepts, then we are assuming everybody understands those deeper concepts as we do. If I describe an apple to be a fruit, but you are under the impression fruit is a type of galaxy, then my reference to fruit did you little good. If such a mistake occurs, where one person uses a concept in a way the other person does not understand or agree with, then they must either (1) pause the current discussion and identify and fix the area of disagreement within the confusing concept, or (2) they must use a different concept that both can agree on. Perhaps you didn’t understand what I meant by fruit, but if I say apple is a kind of food, another helpful concept, you might understand better.

This system presents a certain problem because potentially it can go on forever if both people keep disagreeing about concepts, known as definitionism. If I use option 1 with the apple, and I try to explain what a fruit is I might say it comes from a plant, but if you think plants are a type of cloth, I’ll have to explain that plants are, and if I say plants are made of cells, you might think cells are similar to video games, and so on. In order to prevent this potentially infinite loop of disappointing disagreements I might opt out to use option 2, and just use a different concept or definition to describe apples. However often in a conversation we assume the other person’s concepts can’t be drastically different than ours, so we walk down the disheartening road of definitionism. You might think that definitionism is unlikely, but then you underestimate how different someone’s concept may be, perhaps not of fruit or apples, but of complex concepts as freedom, family, equality, honor, communism, brutal, mighty, virtuous… people can disagree so fundamentally, that arguments can be smothered by definitionism.

While this may seem like a complicated system, we often use it without noticing every day, and often we don’t run into serious flaws like definitionism. Overall I think our system of communication should be greatly improved, but for now it will have to do.

# Conclusions Models

Through our complex web of concepts we may be able to connect some with some simple logic to form conclusions and even predictions about the world we perceive. For example, if part of my concept of apple is that it’s sweet, and part of my concept of fruit is also that fruit are sweet, then I might rightly conclude apples are fruit (first model). I can make this prediction using only my concepts of apple and fruit and some logic, I don’t ever have to have seen tasted or touched either a fruit or an apple to make that prediction/conclusion. When we set up concepts to interact in certain logical/mathematical relationships to make predictions and conclusions about the world we are making models.

Models are the basis for all predictions and conclusions we make about the real world. We create models when we merge observations (concepts) with logical/mathematical operations.

In models it’s especially important to understand which aspects are relevant in the calculation. In my conclusion that apples are sweet, I assumed apples and fruit are similar concepts, but if I observe apples to be small and round as well as sweet, while I know that fruit are larger and rougher (like pineapples) even if they are sweet, then I might not make the conclusion that apples are fruit (second model), because I have included to aspects of size and texture making the previous conclusion that apples are fruit false, unless I change my concept of fruit.

In this way, models can be quite complicated, because using the same concepts, apple and fruit, I arrived at a different conclusion now than before. So which one is right? Both, unfortunately. Because after every conclusion and prediction I have to cite the model I used to get it, including the aspects I deemed relevant to make the conclusion.

In addition, I know my world perception is not necessarily completely accurate, if for example I look at an apple without tasting it, I make a different observation than if I also taste it.

Both these arguments would suggest models to be rather convoluted, difficult things not to mess with. Wrong. Making conclusions and predictions through models is more accurate than any other known method. So how do we overcome these problems?

The second problem solved quite easily, through communication. We can collaborate with our peers to make sure our world perceptions are accurate and complete, making our models more reliable and accurate. This collaboration also solves the first problem, because as long as we describe all of our models well enough for others to understand them, we can work together and make conclusions together.

There may often be conflicting models used to make similar conclusions. Like in my example of the apple, if I argue for the first model, and you argue for the second model who’s model do we agree on. Because we are both experts at communication, we managed to explain to each other how our models work, and we’ve agreed on the properties of the various concepts (that fruit is sweet, that apples are round…). As it turns out there are several ways to identify the superior model from the inferior one.

Obviously the first step in such a situation is to observe the world for examples of where predictions made by our models fail or succeed predict phenomena in the world. The model that is superior is that which can more often accurately predict observable phenomena in the world. While the method works well for many more concrete empirical sciences, this will not do for abstract concepts that cannot be observed, like in our problem of the apple and the fruit. The concept fruit is abstract, as it serves only as a categorization for other concepts to help us describe the concepts that make up the category fruit. So what shall we do?

# The Forces of Science

Then there are two seemingly opposite forces that might show which model is superior. Occam’s razor (less aspects) and statistical probability (more aspects) are the two forces pushing and pulling on our models to perfect them. There are two basic ways that any given model is inferior to any given other model, if both models attempt to answer the same question, the superior model is the one that makes a conclusion based on more evidence, or the one that is simpler, or both.

In the first case, if the model has more raw data, meaning observations, to back it up, it is superior. This force is called the force of probability, because the more information you have the better your conclusion can be. So this force suggest to use as many aspects as possible in a model. This force is fundamentally a logical one, because logically speaking more data leads to a greater accuracy. In my example with the apple, in my first model I only looked at one aspect, the taste of fruit and apples. However in the second model I used taste, size, and texture to come to a conclusion, making the second model appear to be superior to the first.

However the second force of science is a much more dramatic one, the force of simplicity also referred to as Occam’s razor. It says that the less complicated a model is the superior one. However the basis for this force is not a logical one, it’s an aesthetic argument, therefore it’s not as stable and unchanging. This force depends largely on our own idea of aesthetics. If we feel a model is more complicated than it has to be, we can argue for Occam’s razor to cut it down to a simpler form. This is a serious drawback to the force of probability, as it is fundamentally subjective, rather than objective. Nevertheless, we must do our best to simplify where ever we feel simplification is in order. In our example of the apple, I don’t think either model can be significantly simplified, so neither is superior by the force of simplicity.

This would suggest the first model is superior to the second, and the conclusion apples are not fruit is more accurate than the conclusion apples are fruit. Now you might disagree, but remember your concept of fruit and apples may be different than the concepts described in these two models. In the second model we argued fruit are large and rough like a pineapple, rather than small and smooth like an apple. In the concept of fruit I am familiar with, we agree that fruit can be as large as a pineapple or as small as an apple, and that the texture can be rough like a pineapple’s or smooth like an apple’s. However the aspects of size and texture aren’t completely ignored in our concept of fruit, we are not likely to call something a fruit if it’s as big as a house and as smooth and unyielding as glass (Notice how I did not give you absolute values of the properties of house or glass, but instead I referred to their properties assuming that our concepts of house and glass agree on the aspects of size and texture).
