# The Efficiency Problem

# Problem (1/2)

Organizations have to be able to make good decisions in order to survive and prosper. Since an organization is by definition a collective of individuals, one of the most important characteristics of an organization is when which individuals make and/or contribute to a decision for the organization as a whole. When analyzing organizations it will be assumed all individuals in the organization have to ability to rationally make an individual decision. Individual decisions hereby only differ from collective decisions in that in collective decisions the perceived costs and benefits of the collective are evaluated, not the individual’s.

One way in which an organization can choose to make collective decisions is using a hierarchy, aka a vertical structure. This means, a subset of individuals in the organization are responsible for making certain decisions and relative to any individual there are other individuals that are responsible for making more or less decisions for the group. Traditionally hierarchies have been considered efficient structures because responsibilities and privileges are strictly defined, allowing the collective to quickly and accurately make decisions.

Another way for an organization to make collective decisions is democratically, or horizontally. In a horizontal structure all or almost all individuals in the collective take part in making all collective decisions. This structure would apparently be more inefficient, since collective decisions can in principle only be made if everyone in the group decide together.

Collectivism, the idea of creating and sustaining such an egalitarian structure would seem more favorable to individualism. However if the previously accepted idea that individualism is more efficient cannot be disproved, then by the tenets of Logism, collectivism must be abandoned as an inferior organization structure to individualism.

# Solution (2/2)

First the purpose behind the vertical and horizontal structures must be examined.

Doubtlessly, the more data is evaluated in a decision, the more accurate its conclusion will be. However, an individual cannot collect or evaluate as much data as a group. Through communication individuals can share information with other individuals giving them more data with which they can make more accurate conclusions. This effectively proves the value of communication.

In a vertical system, information is pooled with the superiors. Inferiors collect information, and share it with their superiors, in this way a lot of information can be concentrated relatively quickly among the top of the hierarchy. This allows the elite to make far more accurate conclusions than the inferiors that do not have as much data.

In a horizontal system, in order for a piece of information to help make a conclusion all individuals must be given this information, since they all make the decision together. However if information can be transmitted very quickly, say instantly, then there wouldn’t be a problem, since all individuals would have (instant) access to all the information available.

On the other hand, hierarchies work no differently if information can be communicated instantly, because it’s still only the elite that make the decision. Therefore, as communication improves, a horizontal system improves, getting more and more efficient, while a vertical system does not improve.

The second consideration that must be made are mistakes. In any system, any operation there may at any given time be a mistake. In evaluating data to make a conclusion mistakes can be made. In communicating data mistakes can be made.

In a vertical system, if an individual makes a mistake it may have a much greater negative effect on the collective, since that mistake may play a much greater role in the final conclusion of the decision. However in a horizontal structure a mistake by an individual is virtually meaningless, since the mistake only plays a miniscule part in the final decision. Therefore, a vertical system is more susceptible to mistakes than a horizontal system.

We have suggested communication is what determines how efficient a horizontal system is, and we have determined vertical system are less efficient due to the greater potential for negative consequences due to mistakes. Finally we must examine the nature of communication, at least how it changes to come to a final conclusion about the relative efficiency of horizontal and vertical systems.

Developing technology increases the speed of communication and transportation. Technology comes from science, and science is improved by creating more accurate models to describe phenomena in the real world. As technology advances, communication becomes faster and easier. Over time, technology advances, since it takes time for people to create more accurate models and apply them to their lives.

In conclusion, hierarchies are more efficient as long as communication is relatively slow, since it allows the group easier by concentrating information in a few elite. However there is no real benefit to a vertical system as communication increases, while decisions can be made faster, the same operations must be made for decisions to be made in the first place, furthermore, any mistakes, independently of communication, have a greater negative impact on the entire group. Horizontal systems improve as communication improves, and mistakes are virtually nonexistent in a horizontal system, since a majority of individuals must make a mistake in order for it to impact the final conclusion. Therefore, democracies are not necessarily less efficient than hierarchies, it simply depends on how fast information can be communicated. I would argue we have crossed the point where a democracy is more efficient than a hierarchy, now individuals can collect information quickly enough that it is no longer necessary to have a small elite/aristocracy make the decisions.
