# Science & Technology

Originally written 17 October, 2014.

There are two fundamentally different arguments for gaining knowledge. The means and the ends of Science and Technology are fundamentally different.

## Science

**Means**: Interact with reality

**End**: Comprehend reality

## Technology

**Means**: Comprehend reality

**End**: Interact with reality

Science builds models based on reality. Technology describes reality based on models.

Both science and technology attempt to comprehend reality and to interact with it. Science, above all else, interacts with reality in order to gain comprehension. Technology, above all else, tries to gain comprehension in order to interact with it.

# Science

The purpose of science is comprehension of reality. By building models scientists can make conclusions about reality and based on those models produce refined, more accurate conclusions. Interacting with reality by observing and testing it, are necessary in order to understand it.

Models are built to describe the reality and how it works. Making accurate conclusions is the final goal, not to act according to those conclusions.

# Technology

The purpose of technology is to interact with reality. The argument is that the most efficient way to interact with reality is to understand it. Therefore technology must understand reality to interact with it.

Models are built, to make conclusions about the real world. Based on those conclusions, necessary actions can be taken in reality.
