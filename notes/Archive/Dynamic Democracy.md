# Dynamic Democracy

Originally written September 19, 2014.

# Purpose

1. Encourage members of a group to participate and help make a group decision.
2. Give all members of a group and equal say in the group decision.
3. Make group decisions efficiently and accurately.
4. Encourage experts related to the group decision to participate and share their perspective and their opinion.

# Description

There are three phases for each decision that must be made. In phase I, the question/decision/problem is precisely defined and the context for the decision is laid out. In phase II, all members of the group vote on members to join a committee to vote on the final decision. Finally, in phase III, the committee members make the final decision

## Phase I: Defining the Project

When a member, or several members, think a group decision must be made they can complete a “Project Proposal” which will then be decided upon by the entire group. The Project Proposal is comprised of a series of parameters and questions necessary in order to fully make the decision, it may also involve any data relevant to the decision.

In the Project Proposal the following topics must be included:

- A detailed list of all questions related to the main issue
- Evidence and Research relevant to the issue
- A time frame for when the decision must be made and what kind of committee should make the decision
- The type of committee that shall make the decision

*For example, a few merchants think the state should build a bridge over a nearby river so they can trade with people on the other side. They research how bridges are built to become familiar with the project they have started. They sum up their research and all the questions to be answered and decided upon in their Project Proposal. Finally they publish their Proposal deciding that the decision should be made within the next three months and by a technocratic assembly.*

## Phase II: Creating the Committee

Once the Project Proposal is published for all members of the group to see, the second stage begins. Here all members of the group receive one vote, that they either choose to keep for themselves, or that they delegate to someone they agree with. They may choose to abstain from the entire project. If they do not, they must either delegate their vote or keep their vote.

A third alternative is also available: to veto the project. If a member believes the project proposal is incomplete or inaccurate, they may veto the proposal. This veto is not meant for members that take a position against what the project may enact, but only because there is a problem/mistake in the project proposal. As such, when a member vetos they must explain their reason for vetoing, so the authors of the project proposal can revise it and fix the issue. If a certain percentage of the group veto the proposal, the process stops, and the authors must begin again with phase I.

After a certain time period defined by in the project proposal, all people that still have their and perhaps other members’ votes will join a committee for this project. There are different kinds of committees, called a Technocratic Assembly and a General Assembly. In a Technocratic Assembly all members that still have their vote must show proficiency in the areas defined by the project proposal.

## Phase III: Making the Decision

Once the committee has been formed they begin to go through the project proposal answering each question in the project proposal. Answers are determined by vote of all the committee members where each member has as many votes as were delegated to him in Phase II. All issues in the project proposal must be answered within the time frame of the project proposal. If the committee decides the project cannot be decided upon in the allotted time, or if there is some other problem with the project proposal, a ¾ majority can request the original authors of the proposal to revise it accordingly.

Once all the questions in the project proposal are answered and decided upon, the committee dissolves and the decision is executed.

# Message text

The university of Veritus is proud to present a new political treatise about a new form of government called [u]Dynamic Democracy[/u]. With this development we hope to improve legislative and judicial systems on a national and regional scale.

[b]PRINCIPLE[/b]

When citizens believe a legislative change should be made, they can write a "Project Proposal" detailing what they would like to change, and any questions that are relevant to make the change.

They can then publish their proposal whereupon interested citizens can try to gain support for their position on the issue. Each citizen receives one vote for each project, which they can either keep or give to another citizen, or choose to abstain.

After a specific amount of time has passed, all citizens that still have votes and that have not abstained form a committee to debate and vote on the issue and any associated questions. If the committee thinks there is a problem with the Project Proposal they can ask the original author to clarity, or revise certain sections.

Once all questions/problems mentioned in the Project Proposal have been addressed by the committee, the final decision is executed, and the committee dissolves.

[b]STRENGTHS[/b]

The greatest strength of this system is that citizens can directly participate in every legislative decision that is made. If they are interested in the issue and have some expertise in the subject, they can ask other like-minded citizens to give them their vote and join the committee. Although it requires citizens to be more active in the nations' legislative decisions, ultimately only the few people who are really interested in the subject have to make the decision on behalf of all the citizens who gave them their votes. The more votes a committee member has, the closer his position on the subject is to the public as a whole.

Unlike a representative democracy, where representatives make all the decisions for their constituents for the entire term, even when the constituents may have slightly different positions on some issues, dynamic democracy allows the people to choose the right representative for each issue.

Unlike a direct democracy, where citizens must get involved in every proposal that is made, only those interested/motivated have to join the committees and make the final decision. Direct democracy often requires citizens to study every issue in detail to make sure they vote correctly on every decision. Dynamic democracy, however, requires only that the citizens delegate their vote to a representative that has similar
