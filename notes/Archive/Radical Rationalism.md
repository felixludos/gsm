# Foreword

Philosophy is often divided into 5 domains: metaphysics, epistemology, logic, aesthetics, and ethics. In the spirit of this division, I have organized the following articles by beginning with metaphysics, taking a path through logic and aesthetics, ending with ethics, while epistemology is meant as the overall theme.

It’s natural to start with metaphysics and end with ethics because this organization allows the articles to follow certain trends:

Abstract -> Concrete

Assumption -> Conclusion

Descriptive -> Prescriptive

Expository -> Persuasive

While these trends are not the focus of the articles, the reader should keep them in mind to get a better understanding of the perspective and stance of the articles.

# Deep Metaphysics

## The Game

Before discussing how the world works and building a complex system for everything from knowledge to beauty we should identify the most basic, fundamental characteristic of reality. This characteristic can be very abstract, but it will guide us into more practical discussions.

The deepest, most fundamental characteristic of reality is success, or more precisely, the tendency to work toward success. Success is itself rather vague, but however it is interpreted by entities (see Axiom 3) in reality, the entities will work toward success.

The concept of a game embodies this demand for success very effectively because independently of what the game is, or how it works or who participates, the purpose is to win. Therefore, reality should, in its most basic form be interpreted as a game, with players and rules, rather than a story with characters and events. While some may be content with seeing reality as a story, this view misses the fundamental aspect of reality – success. As we perceive ourselves to be able to take actions in the world, and that the world is, at least on some level, affected by our actions, it would seem the model of a game works far better than that of a story.

A precise description of the concept game is itself difficult, but for now the aspects of the concept that interest us is that the purpose of a game is to win (that is, to succeed), that there are rules to the game (that is, success is dependent on certain relationships), and that there are “players” who participate in this game.

## True Reality

In order to develop a comprehensive system of reality we must make three assumptions. However these assumptions are so abstract and natural, that we shall call them axioms.

1. Axiom of Information: reality is composed of data
2. Axiom of Change: the data changes (that is to say, reality changes)
3. Axiom of Interpretation: the data can be interpreted

The first of these axioms establishes the existence of information in reality, which seems very natural. Using our senses we get data about reality, and while if we had different senses the data we receive would doubtlessly be different, in order to sense the world in any way, we would have to receive data about the world. To simplify our system we will not differentiate between different mediums of data, like seeing vs. hearing, because ultimately we are just talking about data.

The second axiom is also very acceptable, however it must be understood in a certain way. I do not specify the criterion by which the data changes. For example, in multivariable calculus, a function can only be differentiated with respect to a certain variable, if that variable is not specified then the derivative cannot be found. The second axiom does not specify with respect to which variable data changes, implying that data changes by every variable. That means reality changes over time, space, color, mass, energy, and every other aspect you care to imagine. While it may be difficult to imagine what it means for reality to change over color because we naturally think in terms of time and space rather than color, we can still demonstrate that reality is in fact dependent on every aspect we can imagine.

The third axiom finally allows us to make use of the data we receive. We can not only receive data but we can interpret it in different ways. That last part is integral, we must be able to interpret the world in different ways, otherwise it is completely deterministic, in which case it is no longer a game, but a story. This is in principle the essence of the game: depending on how well entities interpret the data they receive, they can either be more or less successful.

Side Note: Think Markov Decision Process – we are agents in a state space, we can take actions which then change the state, potentially giving us a reward. Unfortunately, the world is not completely observable, so we are not fully aware how the actions we take will change the state, but that is up to us to determine by interpreting the information we perceive.

## Concepts

Another fundamental piece of reality is language, but we won’t consider the social aspect of language just yet, for now let’s focus on the individual idea of language. Language is for our current purposes a way to organize the data we receive into a more manageable form. While we could think in terms of primary sense data and the system would work just as well, we have a useful tool at our disposal to make reality easier to grasp. Language allows us to develop concepts, which are really names for a certain pattern in the data. For example, we have the concept of a table, this concept gives us an idea of what the data that corresponds to a table should look like. The concept specifies a certain structure or function and gives that pattern a name. This concept must not exist anywhere but inside our head’s, i.e. we could have the concept of a table without ever actually having seen a table (although presumably that concept would differ greatly from, say, my concept of a table).

Concepts are not something we are imposing on reality because remember, reality is nothing but a seemingly endless string of data. We receive that data and parse it into more useful units called concepts.

## Practical Reality

With the tool of concepts we can already build a fairly sophisticated world picture. We are entities which receive data and organize that data into concepts. We can further simplify that description with the use of the term observation. We make observations. Observations are simply data we receive and organize. The composition of all our observations makes up our perception of the world.

But as discussed earlier, we are not passive entities that only make observations, as if we are being told a story. We are active agents in a game where we can make observations and take actions accordingly, now that we understand how we make observations, we can look at the more functional aspect of reality – taking actions.

# Functional Metaphysics

## Decisions

Taking an action involves a decision, consequently the process by which we make decisions is paramount to understanding how the world works. Out of the seemingly endless actions we can take at any given moment, we must continuously judge and decide.

## Models

Fortunately we have an ingenious system to make decisions – models. Models can be thought of like a mathematical function; you plug in some data and get out a result. There are two components to a model, a data component and a processing component. The data component takes in some specific data, and the processing component manipulates that data in some way to come to a result. Both the data itself and the way it is manipulated determine the ultimate result.

As with functions, the data a model requires to make a decision differs from model to model. Additionally, the type of result is different in models, so you can’t use a single model for every type of decision.

The question arises whether the result of a model must be a decision, or if it can be another model. Strictly speaking, models can return other models as result, but in order to make a decision we could then have to keep computing until we got a final result that we can translate into an action, a useful term for this kind of final result is conclusion. Conclusion cannot be models, because that means we have not finished computing.

There is some more to say about the individual components of a model. The data component comprises of data we receive directly from reality, and of conclusions from other models. As we have discussed, we simplify the data into concepts so we can easily plug the data into the models we wish to use.

The second component of models, the processing component, is what manipulates the input data into output data, aka the conclusion. One way a model could process the data is using the rules of math and logic. For example, using the concepts of quantities and amounts, we observe two quantities, which we then plug into model A which multiplies them to form a result. We further use model B which takes in certain sensory information from our eyes to conclude what shirt we are wearing. Then we use model C which takes in the result from model A and the color of your shirt where, if the result is greater than, say, 20 and you are wearing a white shirt, the conclusion is to run, otherwise the conclusion is to wait. In this example we used multiple models to come to a final conclusion, which in this case was the decision to run or wait. The models used different data and rules from logic and math to process the data into a final conclusion. Arguably this example can also be analyzed using a single model by composing models A, B, and C to return the final conclusion, for our purposes, these analyses are equivalent.

## The Perfect World

Let’s take a break from reality and investigate a world just as deep and fascinating as our reality. We can call it the Perfect World for reasons that will become apparent quite soon. In this world, we do not continuously receive data by making observations, but instead we can create our own data using definitions, and now we must only piece it together in a meaningful way.

Because we are no longer constrained by observations we have to make and patterns we have to recognize, we can build a system that is not dependent on observations or evidence, but one based entirely on our own definitions. This system as you may have guessed is logic and math.

This world is perfect, because we can define things absolutely, that is to say, we can use deduction, rather than relying on induction. In the real world, our conclusions are never certain, they are always dependent on a finite amount of evidence that merely supports the conclusion, while with deduction we make conclusions that are certainly correct.

The absolute certainty in the Perfect World may make it seem more powerful or superior to the real world, but keep in mind, the Perfect World is completely abstract because it is defined only by our definitions. The most the Perfect World can ever hope to do is help us make decisions in the real world. Arguably the Perfect World is inferior to the Real World because it comprises of a handful of definitions and their consequences, while the Real World is so complex that, thus far, we are not able to make a single conclusion with certainty.

However, we can’t just write off the Perfect World as primitive or deterministic and move on. Our experience tells us the decisions we make with the help of the Perfect World tend to be better (I’ll explain what a “better” decision is later) than those we make without the Perfect World. While there is no innate, metaphysical reason using the Perfect World tends to lead us to good conclusions, inductively, we can conclude the Perfect World is an excellent tool for making decisions in the real world.

## Creativity & Explanation

Now that we have a basic understanding what a model is and how it functions, we might next ask where they come from. We create models by a process called creativity, which can roughly be thought of as pattern recognition.

While making observations we might recognize some sort of pattern in the data, some sort of relationship between concepts. The recognition of such a relationship is the creation of a model, which we can then use to make decisions based on that relationship. As we get more comfortable with certain concepts, we can build more comprehensive models that use many relationships.

Furthermore we can use the observed relationship to explain a conclusion from a model. If, for example, we are asked to explain why fruit is sweet, then we might use concepts like sugar, nutrients, seeds, etc. because we observe a relationship between these concepts and the sweetness of fruit. Explanation can also help creativity since examining the precise relationships between concepts might lead you to recognizing new relationships which lead to new models.

## Comparing Models

If we can create new models with relative ease, and we use certain models for decisions, then we would naturally like a good way to compare models so our conclusions lead to success. Arguably, discovering a good system to compare models is the most significant achievement of our species (but more on that later).

One way in which we can compare models is by science. Science uses two principles to determine which model is superior: the principle of statistics and the principle of efficiency. The former is arguably more powerful, but in many cases the latter will actually determine which model will be used.

Inductive reasoning embodies the principle of statistics, which in basically states that if the conclusions we make using model A are more consistent with our observations more often than the conclusions we make with model B, then model A is statistically superior to model B. There may be some slight contention about the meaning of consistency in this context, however it should be interpreted first logically, as in, the conclusions lead to fewer contradictions with observations, and secondly linguistically, that is, using a model that uses the predicted and observed values of all the concepts we deem pertinent and evaluates which model is more consistent (this model could in principle use any factors to determine consistency, but as a model it can be subjected to the same test).

The principle of aesthetics deals less with the actual predictions and observations of the models and more with the nature of the models themselves. Broadly speaking we can consider this principle to select the more efficient model, whereby efficient means highest benefit to cost ratio. Calculating the benefits and costs of each model in question uses another model. This sub-model doesn’t actually affect the final conclusion of the models being compared, but instead evaluates the costs and benefits of the models using the characteristics the user judges relevant.

As demonstrated by the Grue example, the principle of statistics alone is not sufficient to determine the superiority of a model over another model. However the flexibility of the principle of aesthetics, allowing additional models to judge efficiency allows the user to definitively compare any two models and find the superior one.

## Experiments

To fully understand how the principles of science compare models I shall introduce a formal module to compare models, the experiment. As every student studying the “scientific method” learns, the traditional method consists of 4 basic steps: making a prediction (based on a hypothesis), observing the outcome (sometimes indirectly using measurements), and making a conclusion about the hypothesis based on the actual outcome and the prediction.

This method is a highly contrived form of scientific practice, which in reality is a much simpler and powerful process. An experiment consists of a scientist comparing different models. The scientist evaluates the conclusion of each model being tested with the same input data, observes the actual outcome, and finally sorts the models by statistical and aesthetic superiority.

The input data must be the same for each model being tested, but that does not meant each model must use the input data provided in the same way (if that were the case, the models would actually be identical). This way, every model has the same data available, while still being able to choose freely what pieces of data to use in what way to ultimately make a conclusion.

In practice, experiments are often conducted to investigate a certain aspect of the model. In this case the models being tested will be very similar except for the aspect being tested. The model that does take the aspect into account is sometimes called the experimental hypothesis, while the model that ignores the aspect is called the null hypothesis. For example, an experiment may investigate the effects of sunlight on plant growth, where the experimental hypothesis might be that plant growth is proportional to sunlight, while the null states there is no correlation between plant growth and sunlight.

Imagine you are conducting an experiment to investigate the outcomes of throwing a pair of six-sided dice. Let A be a model that predicts all numbers have an equal probability of occurring, so to find the probability of any one number, only the number of possible outcomes (different marcostates) must be known. Let B be a model that predicts the probability of each number occurring is proportional to the number of combinations that can be made with the dice that are thrown (different microstates), so in order to calculate the probability both the possibilities per dice, and the number of dice must be known.

Now we ask the question how many times the outcome of throwing two six-sided dice will be two if we throw the dice 100 times. Model A uses the fact that there are eleven possible macrostates (2-12) to predict that 9 of the throws will result in a two. Model B uses the fact that there are 36 microstates, and only 1 microstates for the outcome of 2, to predict that only 3 of the throws will result in a two.

Now we make observations on the outcomes of 100 dice rolls, and let’s say we observe 4 of the 100 rolls to be a two. Since the prediction of model B is closer than that of model A, we can conclude that model B is statistically superior.
