# Fundamentals

At the most fundamental level all any organism gets is data. Physically speaking this data can be said to come in the form of electricity and chemicals. Of course, the organism doesn’t think of the data as electricity or chemicals, because it reformats the data using biological models that its species has developed in its evolution. However an organism does not only receive data; it also transmits data. For most organisms the story ends there, they receive data from “the real world,” interpret it using their built-in models, and act according to the results of their models.

Some organisms however, have developed what will here simply be called a “consciousness.” As all traits of all organisms this consciousness was evolved through natural selection. The reason that the consciousness trait successfully took hold in some species alive today is that the consciousness fundamentally improves the way the organism can make decisions, which in turn makes it more likely to pass on its newly gained trait.

The consciousness allows the organism not only to recognize certain patterns like the biological models, but also recognize new patterns and to develop models based on those. The consciousness allows an individual organisms to create a model, rather than requiring genetic mutations to slowly improve models though natural selection over generations.
