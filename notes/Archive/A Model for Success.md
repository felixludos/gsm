# A Model for Success

## Motivation (1/2)

All animals are born with an inherent way of making decisions. This decision-making system evolved over time, just like any other trait. Just as all animals have a way to reproduce, all animals have a way to respond to their environment, meaning that they have to make decisions about what they do.

For humans this decision making process takes the form of the emotional system. These emotions compel us to certain actions in certain situations. The emotional system encourages actions that maximize positive emotions and minimize negative emotions.

When a decision is made a certain action has to be taken. Therefore we must somehow be motivated to do so. Any action is only carried out because there is more motivation to act in that way than in another way.

That is why humans, and other animals, evolved the trait of emotions: To make decisions and take actions that should benefit the individual (and so the species). Most other animals use a more primitive emotional system, commonly referred to as instincts. Of course, Humans have instincts too, but those are simply actions that our emotional system encourages us to do, or not to do. Humans have evolved so many different emotions to cope with the many different situations they face where emotions have to propose some course of action.

In different situations different emotions can compel us to a particular action. This depends on how the human emotional system has evolved over time. The precise emotions a person feels in a certain situation varies slightly for each individual (like any other inherited trait). For example, if someone hurts us then we feel pain, perhaps also some fear, shame, or anger, whatever the precise mixture of emotions, they will probably compel us to an action that will prevent or minimize such negative emotions.

Every emotion ultimately motivates us to a certain action, these actions might be completely different, but one common feature of all emotions is that they lead to motivation.

Just because we are motivated toward a certain action doesn’t necessarily mean we will actually do it. Other factors and other decision making processes may overrule the course of action proposed by the emotional system in any given situation.

The diagram on the right shows a basic flowchart of how the emotional system motivates a certain action. Different emotions motivate us to certain actions in different situations. The reason we can feel so many different emotions is because we have to respond to so many different situations.

## Success (2/2)

This model of the emotional system helps us analyze other central concepts, such as success. Success is obviously a relative term, so an individual (or group) is only successful or unsuccessful in comparison to another individual (or group).

Decision-making processes have two stages: to decide upon a course of action (Decision Phase), and to motivate the person to follow that proposal (Motivation Phase). If a decision-making process lacks one of those pieces it will not be very effective thereby making the person using that decision-making process unsuccessful in any decision.

The emotional system has perfected the Motivation Phase, emotions can push us to do things that seem completely absurd from a rational perspective. After some time passes we often regret such decisions, so the system is weak in the Decision Phase. The emotional system analyzes only very few aspects of the environment to make a decision, on the other hand, this lets the emotional system make decisions very quickly. In short, the emotional system makes bad decisions, but it can really motivate you to make bad decisions.

The decision-making process that has perfected the Decision Phase is the rational system, or reason. With reason you can analyze every aspect of a problem and take it into account when making the decision, the drawback is that it can take much longer to come to an acceptable conclusion. Unfortunately, for most humans, reason does not motivate them nearly as much as the emotional system does, so many of our actions come from the emotional system. In short, the rational system makes great decisions, but often can't motivate you make those decisions.

The emotional system is inherently part of the person, just as much as an arm or head; a person is hardwired to make decisions based on the emotional system. But that’s not enough to be successful in the environment humans are living in.

Success is not measured in luck, or intelligence, or strength, at least not significantly. The only significant factor of success is how effectively the individual can control their motivation.

If they can motivate themselves to act upon the decision of the rational system, rather than the emotional system, they will be far more successful. The emotional system only adapts to the environment as fast as evolution through natural selection can evolve it. But the environment of humans changes much faster, just think how different the environment of people 200 years ago was. On the evolutionary scale, 200 years is nothing, but in human terms, the world can turn upside down in 200 years.

Therefore it’s not enough to rely on a decision-making system than adapts by evolutionary standards like the emotional system; in order to be successful we have to use a much more adaptive and precise system, like the rational system.
