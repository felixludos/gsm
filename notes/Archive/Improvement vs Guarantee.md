# Improvement vs Guarantee

# Improvement

As time passes, if a species’ models for predicting changes in the environment improve, so too they must expend less resources in order to keep the probability of survival constant.

Without improving the species’ models, meaning the species does not adapt, the environment will eventually become so different that the species can no longer survive, so it dies out.

There are two ways for the species to adapt by improving its models of the world: dilation and translation.

A species that learns to control new aspects of the environment can **dilate** its necessary resources to maintain the same probability that the environment will change in that way. If the species controls more aspects of its environment, it must use less resources to maintain the same probability of its survival. This lessens the cost, but the benefit is still the same as the probability the species will survive is still the same. Here the species improves its models by using more accurate data to come to a conclusion because the species controls more aspects, it can make better observations about the aspects and their effects on natural phenomena. So by learning to control more aspects of the environment a species can becomes more efficient.

By discovering and identifying new aspects of the environment, a species can **translate** its current range of manageable changes in the environment to more closely relate to the actual conditions of the environment at any given time. Here the species improves its models by expanding the models to include more aspects to come to a conclusion.

# Guarantee

To **guarantee** the survival of a species at any given instant the species must expend infinite resources. Whereby the more resources are expended, that is, the more precautions are taken for possible changes of the environment, the more likely the species is to survive in that instant.

In any given instant the species can expend a larger amount of resources to increase the probability of its survival. However this is not necessarily more efficient because, while the benefit increases when the probability increases, the cost also increases because more resources are expended. Qualitatively speaking, spending more resources to guarantee, or almost guarantee, survival does not necessarily help the species, and it may actually harm the species as it may be more inefficient.

Expending resources to prepare for unknown-unknowns (aspects of the environment we have not discovered yet) is useless because the species does not know what resources will be necessary to combat the unknown-unknowns. However, expending resources to prepare for known-unknowns (aspects we have discovered but cannot control) improves the chances that the species will survive. For example, a society that has not discovered the effects of radiation cannot expend resources to protect itself from radiation. However a society that has discovered harmful effects of radiation can expend resources to discover ways to control radiation.
