# Liberté, Égalité, and Fraternité

The highest goal of any species is doubtlessly to survive, as a species, not as individuals. Individuals will die, but a species can live forever.

Therefore the goal of every individual within a species is not to survive, but to do their utmost to ensure the survival of the species. The brighter they leave the world the easier it will be for the species to survive.

If the purpose of life is to leave the world a brighter place than you found it, then you must produce more than you consume. It stands to reason that the more you produce and the less you consume the brighter you make the world. Therefore, in order to best fulfill the purpose of our lives we must strive to produce as much while consuming as little as possible.

In order to produce as much as possible you must consume more than just to survive. After all survival is not your highest priority, the advancement of your species is. So although you have to consume more than the bare minimum, it will allow you to produce so much more.

## Liberté

*Inter-Organ Systems*

Every organ is an indivisible individual. Rather than wasting resources and endangering the species

## Égalité

*Intra-Organ System*

All cells are as productive to the organ as possible. So they all deserve a reward as much as they need. They themselves are best to determine what they need.

Specialization is more efficient than variation. Through specialization humanity has already achieved greatness, but we still hang on to the basic principle of “variation to survive.” We already control so much of our environment, is there still need to be dictated by nature? Through science and technology we are constantly controlling more and more of our environment, the chance of humanity becoming extinct is becoming so small that nature itself can no longer control us (however there is still a considerable chance that we will make ourselves extinct!). We have to bread free of this ancient system of “variation to survive.” Now we should adopt a new goal, “specialize to improve.” It is vital that we continue to study the natural world, so that we can continue to control more and more aspects of our environment and we can eventually become immortal.

## Fraternité

*Inter-Cell System*

The third main pillar of the Termite Project is Brotherhood. All cells are brothers. Since they all produce for the same organ there is no reason for them to fight one another. Of course it can’t be expected that all cells feel equally toward everyone else. Small groups of cells may grow together forming tissue. There is no clear line between romantic and social relationship. There is no monogamy, no marriage, no family (at least not in the traditional sense of the word). The organ all together is one family.

The idea of marriage is to make a public declaration of love. Not to say that a marriage is necessary to love, the only marriage is so vibrant in our culture is because we are monogamous. Marriage is used, in a primitive sense, to mark one’s territory, to share with the public your ownership over your spouse and/or children. However without ownership, why should there be marriage.

Monogamy may still be a virtue. It’s possible that we are instinctually hard-wired for monogamy and that it goes deeper than simply tradition. Monogamy may still be a virtue, but there is no need for it, lovers no longer have to make a contract to raise children, they are free to live their lives.

The organ is your family, everyone is your brother or sister, your daughter or son, your father or mother. The old may still be respected while the younger are praised. The young represent the bright and modern future while the old represent the loyal and intelligent past.

Closer friends/lovers form groups of tissue. This simply means that they feel closer toward one another compared to other cells. Strong relationships are discouraged, instead light, graceful relationships are encouraged.
