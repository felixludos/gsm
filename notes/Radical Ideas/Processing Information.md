## The Information Age

In the past few centuries, the world has experienced an incredible increase in the amount of communication and transportation of ideas and goods around the world. As the cost technology (communication and transportation) decreases and the speed increases, we are exposed to even more new ideas to improve our decision making and technology, suggesting a kind of exponential growth of new information and ideas.

With the advent of the internet, we declared ourselves to be living in a new age - the information age. As with all change, old beliefs and models may become obsolete and replaced. However, on the scale of society, whole institutions may have been built on the basis of outdated ideas, and understandably, the dismantling of such institutions may face resistance. While we could lament all the resources that are lost to the constant struggle tearing down past accomplishments in the name of moving forward and improving everything from infrastructure to social policies, ultimately this is a question of collective decision making, which we will discuss elsewhere.

Here we will focus on a few important ways to think about the recent dramatic changes to the spread of information and how we can continue to get as much out of all this as possible.

### Fake News

One common complaint about the veritable flood of information we are confronted with every day is that we cannot devote the necessary amount of time to properly filter and process all the information. Especially considering how easy it is to produce information that quickly becomes very widespread, it would appear that the great quantity of information invariably makes the quality suffer. It's so easy to think of the unprecedented spread of unverified or even unverifiable information as a problem in direct response to technological innovation that many have argued that the explosion of so called "fake news" to be one of the central challenges of the information age. A quite common response to this apparent problem is to suggest that we should slow down innovation or research until we can identify a "safe" or "ethical" way to proceed. This is fearmongering codswallop!

First of all, research is precisely the method by which we identify how to make use of novel ideas and technologies, so any qualms over how current scientific trends are affecting society can only ever lead to a conclusion that we should be doing more research. Decreasing research in any area is never a sensible course of action, you can certainly argue that we should be doing more to, for example, research ethical or sociological changes that result from new technologies - but this cannot come at the cost of further developing the technologies themselves precisely because this slows down our understanding and ability to make sense of them.

Next let's address Fake News specifically.

### Death of Labels

In communication, we use labels to condense complex concepts into a succinct word or phrase. This can significantly increase the bandwidth of communication, however, it comes at the cost of precision. When the same label is used in many different contexts, then any additional subtleties can be lost, thereby making transmission of the information more error-prone and noisy. This paired with a substantial increase the amount of information we are exposed can make such inconsistencies especially apparent. However, the solution is obviously not to try to limit the amount of information we receive, but to limit the value we put into the labels that are used.

The more complex the concept behind a label is, the more likely its use can be misleading, and therefore the more caution must be exercised when using it. For example, the word "freedom" can have very different connotations depending on the context, meanwhile the word also carries significant historical and cultural baggage further complicating it. As a result, I suggest labels like "freedom" have almost entirely lost their use, and can effectively be entirely filtered out as the chance that they will be misunderstood or misused in most casual encounters significantly outweighs the amount of helpful information they convey.

## Evaluating Information

As we are exposed to more information, we should search for better tools to efficiently evaluate the information so we can actually benefit from all that new data.

An age-old metric for good information is truth - ie arguments that are more true tend to be better arguments than those that are not. However, there are both theoretical, and practical reasons why truth is actually a rather dangerous metric to use, and that it simply doesn't scale at all.

For example, imagine your friend tells you "you should invest in gold because most people believe there will be an economic depression in the next 10 years". Now this argument may seem quite reasonable, because most investments tend to lose money in a depression, while the value to gold may stay more stable. It also sounds reasonable that if a majority of people think this will happen soon, then considering how much the actual behavior of an economy depends on people's forecasts, it appears your friend's advice should probably move you to action soon. However, if we ask
