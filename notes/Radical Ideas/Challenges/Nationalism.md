# Nationalism

One would think the 20th century featured enough suffering that we would have done away with the concept - but apparently not.

Points:

- Emotional disclaimer: I try not to get emotional over these ideas, but considering the suffering involved it's rather difficult, even for me, to discount the emotional aspects of this argument.
- Differentiating tribalism and nationalism
    - Tribalism - differentiating an in-group and an out-group, this is not necessarily a bad thing (it's not unreasonable to trust your friends and direct acquaintances more than strangers), however, we have to be careful about how our definitions of in-group affect our actions (especially in the context of collective decisions)
    - Nationalism - encourages a certain in-group that for all intents and purposes should be discouraged. The in-group propagated by nationalism is very broad, dangerously so. Specifically, nationalism is a devotion to the undying state that you are part of.
- Nature and Function of Nationalism
    - The state is undying - the people are not tied to an individual, but a (seemingly) undying entity, the state, which is the subject of our loyalty.
    - As part of nationalism, a set of core "national values" is emphasized and encouraged throughout the society, which can affect everything from political and economic policy to ethical and cultural norms.
    - This nation is better than any other (by virtue of it's values or history or some other bs)
    - As a member of the nation, you benefit from a set of priveledges (often related to the national values: social programs, legal protection, voting, military protection), but you also take on a set of duties (some sacrifices you have to make as a member, eg. tax, military service, abiding by local laws and regulations, not being a member of another nation)
- Track record - nationalism in history:
    - First of all, nationalism is a relatively recent development, primarily because it requires a significant level of cohesiveness certain abstraction. Modern nationalism started in the late 18th century with the French Revolution.
    - Rome as case study. Can probably be called a nation, however personal loyalty was favored far above that to an abstract state. Considering how long it took for people outside of Rome to have rights like those in Rome, for most of the golden age, only the core (Rome and parts of Italy can be said to encourage nationalism, while most of the empire was mostly loyal to the local rulers and administrators over anyone in a far off capital, much less the state that capital leads.
    - Contrast with a few great empires in history
        - China - before the revolution of 1911, the mandate of heaven was the explanation for why the current rulers (eg. dynasty) have the right to rule over their subjects. Importantly, if the ruler was unable to remain in power and is replaced, then that simply means they lost of mandate of heaven, so the new ruler has the right to take control. This concept enables power struggles to be accepted rather readily by the majority of the nation. This is a built-in system to say
        - Europe and India - small empires controlled by feudal lords, and kings. An entire empire could rest solely on an individual. Contracts between empires were almost always directly tied to the rulers that signed them. As a result, the high middle ages and even up to the enlightenment era featured very tumultuous diplomacy where the death of a ruler caused alliances and peace treaties to become voided so neighbors often invaded the nation as a direct result.
    - Modern nationalism - making deals not with rulers, but with nations
    - The suffering - modern warfare (World War 2, the Great War, Cold War conflicts), essentially all ethnic conflicts (the Holocaust, the Indian wars, a good chunk of the middle east since independence), colonization/imperialism and independence therefrom (sub-Saharan Africa, Opium wars, essentially all modern revolutions), oppression (large-scale censorship,
    - History of moving beyond nations
        - Defining/protecting sovereignty
        - The league of nations
        - UN, WTO
        - EU, ASEAN, African Union
        - Human rights, international law
- The good side of nationalism
    - Increasing cohesiveness inside a nation - this is necessarily double-edged (the closer you feel to those with the same passport, the further you feel from those with a different one).
    - Simplifies the enemy - is this even an upside? This makes arguments sound more black and white instead of less so, which is not a good thing.
    - Loyalty - In the military, commanders have generally encouraged a certain level of unquestioning loyalty from subordinates. Instead of requiring each commander to achieve personal loyalty from their subordinates (as was done for most of human history before the modern age), they can appeal to their subordinates by setting their superior rank as a proxy for the abstract state. This is undoubtedly very useful for organizations that want to discourage questioning and second guessing among subordinates. The real question is, how
    - Simplifies diplomacy - nations dealing with one another is simpler than having provinces, or cities deal with one another directly. This is true but thanks to technology, it is increasingly feasible for a single administrative body for the globe to be the alternative to nations as opposed to smaller entities.
- Why we need to get rid of it:
    - Encouraging global cohesiveness - nationalism emphasizes the difference between peoples in different nations, thereby making it challenging to globalize, which would increase the spread of ideas and information (which is especially valuable from people very different from you) thereby hurting everyone (in the ingroup and outside).
    - Encourages passiveness - what can **you** do about a conflict between **nations**. So indirectly, encouraging nationalism encourages a small group of individuals to make decisions for many.
    - Slippery slope: Arguments encouraging some sort of ideal realization of the values of the nation, this alone is just propaganda, however it is a slippery slope to the next step: showing how those in the out-group do not embody those values. That is very dangerous because it encourages us, in the in-group, to act against them (eg. by manipulation, military intervention, outright conquest, oppression, eugenics, cleansing).
        - The especially dangerous part of this reasoning, is that it is very difficult to argue against it: if you are in the in-group, then you should agree because you share the same values, so we are only doing those in the out-group a favor, and if you are in the out-group, then those acting against you will not lend much credence to your complaints precisely because you are out (even if you claim to share those values).
    - Simplifying administration and trade - consolidating administrative offices across the world (benefiting from multinational expertise), the economy becomes far simpler (instead of having to take into account the consequences of any policy wrt to the trade regulations and systems of each country, there is only one system).
    - Often used as a proxy to encourage certain decisions, thereby obfuscating the decision at hand. Say we have to make a collective decision of a problem. Now I connect choice A with our national values and argue that if you don't agree with A you are not abiding by our national values. Now you may disagree in a number of ways, for example: arguing how our national values do not agree with choice A or saying choice B is more consistent with our national values. Now we can debate, however, we aren't really debating over the merits of choices A and B by themselves, but over how to interpret those choices through the highly biased (and possibly outdated) lenses of national values.
    - The problems where the bias and obfuscation due to nationalism is especially strong are collective decisions concerning the actions of a nation. Those are quite common and can be very impactful, therefore encouraging nationalism causes significant bias in some of the most common and most important collective decisions we have to make - seems like a bad idea all around.
- Conclusion:
    - Defining and maintaining an in-group can increase the efficiency of social interactions (eg. I can let my friend borrow my car without them signing a contract), however this is a "personal in-group" where you have some direct connection to every member.
    - The alternative, "abstract in-groups", where you don't directly know all members, must be treated with far more suspicion. Arguments that put forward decisions (especially collective decisions) in the name of such a group (ie. you should agree/do something **because** you are a member, or **because** someone isn't a member"), must be treated with extreme care. In almost all cases, this leads to fanaticism that can be very damaging to society (eg. the Holocaust, the Indian Wars, slavery, racism, etc.).
