# Arguments & Debates

We argue and debate for one and only one true purpose: to learn. Any other side effect of presenting an argument is unintended, and, ideally, ignored and discouraged. 

## Arguments

~~Let's back up first: we define the raw input we experience through our senses as "sensory data." This sensory data includes all of the input we receive from our environment. For all intents and purposes, we might imagine the sum total of the inter-molecular forces between any molecule not part of *you* (defined by some arbitrary but reasonable metric) with any molecule that is part of *you*.~~ 

~~Maybe the sound of "arbitrary metric" or that squishy picture still leaves a bad taste in your mouth when you consider that molecules hardly seem to be the most fundamental building block of the environment.~~

That was all very abstract, but this framework will now help us answer the original question: Why argue? The answer (as the answer to all questions about the real world) boils down to how our best models interpret our observations. In this case, my best models can roughly be summed up by these processing steps:

- There are patterns in the raw sensory data I interpret as being other agents (eg people) distinct from myself in the environment. As I do not have access to the raw sensory experience of these other agents, I model their behavior (and by extension the their reward function), which significantly improves my predictions of my future.
- By engaging in certain behaviors with these other agents (aka being "social"), I consistently observe patterns ("communication") in my raw sensory data which can relatively easily be transformed into information to improve my own model (ie the social interactions helps me learn how the world works).

Maybe the steps above sound a little pedantic and overly formal - and I completely agree, nobody talks (or even thinks) like that. That's the point - we have come up better ways of transmitting and interpreting information we communicate (ie. language) precisely because we that allows us to improve our models, which in turn allows us to make better decisions, and utilmately maximize the reward no matter how we define it. The transmission of a model we think is useful is an argument. If we send other agents (ie people) useful information, they can send us useful information back. And the better we can encode the information we send, and decode the information we receive, the more we can improve our models.

So why argue?

1. Turning an idea or model in our head to an explicit argument allows us to improve it - In the process of compressing our ideas and models into a format that can be transmitted and understood (ie. language), we have to critically analyze those ideas and models and make them explicit, rather than allowing them to be in some more nebulous form (of say, circuits of neurons in our brains). This critical analysis allows us to learn, just by making an argument independently of what anyone listening to the argument draws from our ramblings. This is also commonly called "learning by teaching".
2. All responses to your argument make it easier to model their behavior - No matter how useless their response can seem, you can use their response to better model *their* behavior, and thereby improve your predictions of how they (specifically, as well as people in general) will respond.

## Debates

Just the act of interacting socially gives us the benefits above. However, thanks to the high fidelity of language, we can try to communicate our models *directly* to compare how different agents make decisions. This is the origin of debates - the process by which we take turns describing our models to improve each other's models.

Note that this answers the question without any notion of truth or persuasion. This suggests what we really gain from a debate is the new perspective of the person we are debating. In some sense, some of the information from their raw sensory experience (that we do not have access to) leaks through the debate, which gives us more information about the environment.

### Provocation

This suggests, that when debating we want to find people that have a very different perspective than we do because then there is more new information we can incorporate into our models - there's more to learn from people that think differently than you. As long as they have a different position from you (ie. they see the world differently), you keep debating, ie presenting new evidence or reasoning to reconcile your view with your opponents.

Your goal in a debate is not to convince your opponent that your position is correct, quite the opposite, you really just try to describe your position as accurately as possible while trying to make it sound as ridiculous and outragous as possible. As long as your argument sounds outragous, someone will disagree. As soon as someone disagrees, they will use their models to find and poke as many holes in your argument as possible.

As your opponent presents all the flaws in your argument, you can work out solutions, either by patching up the holes yourself or by integrating your opponents proposed solutions (ie. their argument) which presumably doesn't suffer from the same shortcomings.

### Noisy Communication

Another related benefit of debates comes from the fact that no matter how well you try, you won't perfectly be able to communicate your model to your opponent. Some information is lost in your encoding of your ideas into language, not to mention the decoding of your argument by your opponent to "understand" your argument. 

However, rather than that being a major shortcoming of debates, that actually leads to another major benefit - much like imperfect copies of DNA of an organism actually increases the likelihood that organism (and its descendants will and reproduce). The imperfect copy of your argument is what your opponent dissects and criticizes, so any information that is "lost in translation" adds fuel to possible ways your opponent can challenge your position. If you could transmit a perfect copy, then the opponent finding a flaw in the argument would be just as difficult as you finding a flaw yourself, so there'd be no point in arguing. So the imperfections give your opponent more ways to attack, some of which might be easier to remedy with some additional clarifications (which are themselves noisy). Therefore, thanks to the imperfection of language, debates become a kind of iterative procedure to make our arguments (and thereby our models) more robust and stronger.

### Radicalism vs. Moderacy

One seemingly favorable end to a debate is a compromise. However, I would argue that compromises, and more generally, taking moderate positions is almost always a very bad idea.

The alternative is radicalism. A radical position is one that builds off of some internal logic or framework to derive lots of practical answers. A compromise is a process by which multiple foundations of arguments are connected by some very simple rule (eg. split down the middle).

I have no qualms over using criticism of one position to improve it - that's the whole point of the debate. However, it is important to differentiate adapting and improving a position to make it stronger from merely mixing positions.

Each position builds on a (usually) fairly complex set of 

For example, quantum mechanics builds on a different foundation than classical mechanics. For questions where the prediction of quantum mechanics is different from that of classical mechanics, we can debate which model is better. However, we would probably not do well if we just say we'll average both of our predictions or each time our predictions differ we flip a coin to decide what system to use. A better solution to the debate would be to characterize the kinds of problems where classical mechanics is better and to differentiate those from the kinds of problems where quantum mechanics is better. Even better, we can try to unify both frameworks, as is done in modern physics by the correspondence principle, which requires that any behavior predicted by quantum mechanics should match what is predicted by classical mechanics in the high energy limit.
